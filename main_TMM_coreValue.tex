Subject: A brief summary of TMM, and a project of capacity building in emergency care\\
 \today



%I'm writing to you as the chief doctor who lives in your Hargeisa dormitory house with other TMM members. We appreciate your kindness and cooperation very much.

%%


I sincerely hope you are doing well as I write this email. I'm writing to welcome you to the Taiwan Medical Mission (TMM) in the Republic of Somaliland. 
We look forward to working with you.

As you may know, TMM is an oversea mission that provides healthcare for the people of Somaliland. Dr. Dave Lin, an obstetrician, Josh Huang, a registered nurse, and Dr. Tex Li-Hsing Chi, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, make up our team of medical professionals. We work at Somaliland's Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH) to provide service while building capacity.

Josh teaches nurses how to think critically, which enhances nursing care. We also contribute to the system and equipment upgrades in the orthopedic ward for women. 
Since June 2023, TMM's new project has included a pap smear project to screen for cervical cancer with an obstetrics and gynecology (OBS/GYN) director named Dr. Fatima and Dr. Dave's support, as well as a telepathology project with a pathologist named Dr. Omar to interpret the cytology diagnosis of a pap smear.

TMM also supports the Vitek 2 Compact bacterial identification machine, orthopedic instruments, and implants, the arthroscopic Skryker shaver, trauma kits for soldiers serving on the front lines of battle, oxygen concentrators, autoclaves, a video intubation system, and other medical devices or medicines for use in hospitals.

We work on non-communicable diseases together with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and instruct interns at the University of Hargeisa. 
TMM does telemedicine by collaborating with specialists at Taipei Municipal Wanfang Hospital (TMWH), where TMM is based.


Additionally, we want to promote good oral hygiene and screen khat leaf chewers for oral cancer. 
The HGH medical personnel will also have access to screenings, vaccinations, and treatment options for HBV/HCV viral hepatitis program. 
%After Dr. Dave finishes his mission, an emergency doctor, Dr. Wu from TMWH will join us in July 20231.

With the help of Australian Doctors for Africa (ADFA, URL: https://ausdocafrica.org/), a project that will boost emergency care in HGH is currently underway. This initiative will train local physicians and increase the medical staff's professional expertise, enabling them to provide more systematic and thorough care. In addition, point-of-care ultrasound was implemented in the emergency department and intensive care unit (ICU) on April 2023 by Dr. Max Fraden (Somalilander-American Health Association, SAHA, urlhttps://sahainfo.org/our-vision/).
The creation of a trauma team will allow rapid responses to emergencies delivering prompt and efficient care to patients in severe conditions.

We think that constant support is essential to the accomplishment of our programs. As a result, all of our TMM members have access to mentorship, training, resources, and support networks provided by TMWH headquarters. 
We would also want to provide you with this support.

Our core value is:
\1 TMM offers medical professionals for people in need.
\1 TMM's presence is supposed to bring happiness and safety to everyone around them by improving their health and well-being.
\1 When confronted with a challenge, TMM is resilient in persuading its core value.

I'm writing to ask if it's possible to schedule a teleconference with emergency medical personnel at Hargeisa Group Hospital. 
In order to help us to construct a comprehensive project, we think a teleconference would be beneficial prior to your arrival. The difficulty of delivering medical supplies to Somaliland should have prompted us to start working on this earlier.


We appreciate your thoughts and time. We hope to hear from you shortly. You can contact me at any time via email or WhatsApp (we create a group for you: HGH-ED Taiwan Medical Mission).

%I appreciate your time. If you have any questions or issues about our plan, kindly let us know.
